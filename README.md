# ReDI_Project_2023

This is my ReDI School project for the Fall semester 2023

It's a little Escape Room Game where you an make different choices. 
Depending on your choices you will survive or not.
This is my very first attempt of coding and of course it's far from being finished.
It still has codes, that are not working yet, but hopefully I will figure this out in the future.
